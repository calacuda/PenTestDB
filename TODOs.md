# TODOs:
---
a list of todos.

## Active
- [ ] add interpretation of pipes to command get_cmd() (ie. if something gets piped into a command that can be parsed, parse the output based the program getting piped into.)
- [ ] make the python parsers use objects to output data and make the objects printable via, `__str__(self)`
- [x] add an exit status column to the commands table. (this would allow me to only parse certain commands with they exit successfully and not parse commands like ffuf or wfuzz if the user exits the command prematurely bc they're changing parameters and command line arguments.)
- [x] update install instructions
- [ ] write documentation.
- [x] allow each engagement file to declare its own sql-server conf? (not sure if i wanna do this one.) (i did it.)
- [ ] add listing of engagements.
- [ ] clear out old TODOS. :P (there are many old TODOs in the [cleared](#Cleared) section that date back to the beginning of the project) (they give me motivation but they also clutter this file.)
- [ ] flush out client and server terminal args.
- [ ] test client server mode.
- [x] add `SELECT DISTINCT` to the SQL queries generated by command line arguments.
    - [x] add `DISTINCT` to the query generator.
    - [x] ignore `DISTINCT` key word when generating the list of columns selected.
- [x] add `SELECT TOP` to the keyword generator
    - [x] ignore the `TOP` keyword.
    - [x] skip the next token (the number).
- [ ] improve the dig parser.
    - [ ] change understanding of the difference between ipv4 and ipv6 to be based on record type ('A' vs 'AAAA').
    - [ ]  add 'CNAME' parsing.
- [ ] ~~do [this](https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/whatever/sed+remove+ansi+color+codes) instead of using the strip_ansi_escape crate.~~ even better, do it per parser in python using regex. (the crate removes tabs inserted by ANSI as well.)
- [ ] write a dog parser. (dog is like dig but simpler, and more elegant imo).
- [ ] move the removal of ANSI control codes to the python parsers bc not all parsers need it and it was interfearing with some parsers.
    - [ ] find a python module that can strip ANSI control codes (only the color codes).
    - [ ] remove from the rust code.
    - [ ] add to the python parsers where its important.
        - [ ] add to feroxbuster.py
        - [ ] add to rustscan.py
- [ ] switch to DGraph back end
    - [ ] make the dgraph schema
    - [ ] figure out querying (in either DQL (Dgraph Query Language) or GraphQL)
    - [ ] figure out a clean way to add each entity to the database (and write a GraphQL file to do it)
    - [ ] figure out a clean way to modify any entity to the database (and write a GraphQL file to do it)
    - [ ] write rust code to query, then rust code to add or update.
        - [ ] manually set of a sample database
        - [ ] make querying work
        - [ ] then make adding work (being able to query will make coding and testing the adding process MUCH easier.)
        - [ ] then make modifing work.


## Maybe Do/Future TODOs
- [] add date and time check to client and engagement conf. so it'll not process data before the start date and time. AND alert the user after the engagement is over. set the complete flag to true after the end date and time. (i think this will requires finding a new DateTime library)
- [] ~~add optional IP address ranges to engagement conf. that way the program can check to see if the server is in scope. (maybe use nmap IP formatting) then the client can stop you from going out of scope by making a call in `preexec`~~ maybe much later on down the line.
- [] ~~make numeric values numerically typed in the sql db~~ (not worth it at the time being)
- [] ~~split up local_time column from commands database (on column for year, one for month, day, hour, min, and one fore the time zone offset.)~~ (not worth it at the time being. probably wont be worth it for a while tbh.)


## Cleared
- [x] add an SQL file and a shell script to make the PostgreSQL db.  
- [x] add interaction with SQL
- [x] add password configuration for SQL
- [x] add remote server support (with encryption ofc).
- [x] add a time stamp to the results (added time stamp to command column)
- [x] add hosts and commands to the database first. that way the host & command variables from other tables can contain the id of of the host or command from their respective tables.
- [x] test ssl encryption and remote host connection functionality. ~~(haven't done this yet bc I don't feel like setting up an sql server running elsewhere.)~~ this works! (its a pain in the neck to get configured ssl on postgres but it works.)
- [x] make the program ignore `sudo`, `doas`, `time`, etc, to get the actual command also add interpretation of pipe to get_cmd()
- [x] make host adding edit old host rows if need be
- [x] add dir parameter to output of the parsers for both gobuster and feroxbuster.
- [x] add host row editing. (if at first only the ipv4 adr is known but the dns name is learned later, add the dns name to the same row.)
- [x] same as above but for all tables.
- [x] give the new-engagement subcommand an argument to "activate" the new engagement. (change the engagement line in the config file.)
- [x] and an argument to the engagement subcmd to switch engagements (change the engagement line in the config file.) also add one to check the current engagement.
- [x] implement internal ansi2txt based on [this code](https://github.com/kilobyte/colorized-logs/blob/master/ansi2txt.c) (this was achieved with a module instead.)
- [x] add manual selection of command via command line arg when parsing immediately. (this is done now, but im not pleased that it doesn't know what the command was, only the executable.)
- [x] fixed manual exec setting via cmd line args.
- [x] add terminal based play/pause functionality.
- [x] add a flag to query subcmd to query for then column names of the table.
- [x] add multiple sql server configs 
- [x] add subcmd to switch sql server configs (just like `engagement -a`). (achieved with `config -s`)
- [x] split config into global and user configs.
- [x] add `info` subcmd that will print information like: postgres server host, current engagement completeness, and active status (paused vs. actively parsing).
- [x] give the `quiet_log` server config file param functionality. 
- [x] fix get_cmd() issue where you can't pass arguments to sudo, time, doas, or proxychains. (this is particularly a problem with proxychains.)
- [x] fix feroxbuster parser crashing when outputing help menu on empty args
- [x] add a way to ignore parsers if the command contains the help args.
