# TODOs:
---
- [x] add an SQL file and a shell script to make the PostgreSQL db.  
- [x] add interaction with SQL
- [] add date and time check to client and engagement conf. so it'll not process data before the start date and time. AND alert the user after the engagement is over. set the complete flag to true after the end date and time. (i think this will requires finding a new DateTime library)
- [] ~~add optional IP address ranges to engagement conf. that way the program can check to see if the server is in scope. (maybe use nmap IP formatting) then the client can stop you from going out of scope by making a call in `preexec`~~ maybe much later on down the line.
- [x] add password configuration for SQL
- [x] add remote server support (with encryption ofc).
- [x] add a time stamp to the results (added time stamp to command column)
- [x] add hosts and commands to the database first. that way the host & command variables from other tables can contain the id of of the host or command from their respective tables.
- [x] test ssl encryption and remote host connection functionality. ~~(haven't done this yet bc I don't feel like setting up an sql server running elsewhere.)~~ this works! (its a pain in the neck to get configured ssl on postgres but it works.)
- [] add interpretation of pipes to command get_cmd() (ie. if something gets piped into a command that can be parsed, parse the output based the program getting piped into.)
- [x] make the program ignore `sudo`, `doas`, `time`, etc, to get the actual command also add interpretation of pipe to get_cmd()
- [x] make host adding edit old host rows if need be
- [] make the python parsers use objects and make the objects printable via, `__str__(self)`
- [] ~~make numeric values numerically typed in the sql db~~ (not worth it at the time being)
- [x] add dir parameter to output of the parsers for both gobuster and feroxbuster.
- [x] add host row editing. (if at first only the ipv4 adr is known but the dns name is learned later, add the dns name to the same row.)
- [x] same as above but for all tables.
- [x] give the new-engagement subcommand an argument to "activate" the new engagement. (change the engagement line in the config file.)
- [x] and an argument to the engagement subcmd to switch engagements (change the engagement line in the config file.) also add one to check the current engagement.
- [x] implement internal ansi2txt based on [this code](https://github.com/kilobyte/colorized-logs/blob/master/ansi2txt.c) (this was achieved with a module instead.)
- [x] add manual selection of command via command line arg when parsing immediately. (this is done now, but im not pleased that it doesn't know what the command was, only the executable.)
- [x] fixed manual exec setting via cmd line args.
- [] add an exit status column to the commands table.
- [x] add terminal based play/pause functionality.
- [x] add a flag to query subcmd to query for then column names of the table.
- [] ~~split up local_time column from commands database (on column for year, one for month, day, hour, min, and one fore the time zone offset.)~~ (not worth it at the time being. probably wont be worth it for a while tbh.)
- [] add multiple sql server configs (maybe also allow each engagement file to choose between them?).
- [] split config into global and user configs.
- [] update install instructions & write documentation.
- [] add `info` subcmd that will print information like: postgres server host, current engagement completeness, and active status (paused vs. actively parsing).
