# Development Notes:

---

- use PostgreSQL for database bc metasploit does (no reason to have two sql db's on one system)
- maybe add ability to interface with metasploit's sql db (so the user can use out side scanning tools and use those results in metasploit)
- add an argument to the client to check if the engagement is done. that way I can conditionally source a shell script from `~/.zshrc`
- add parser setting for wether to run program encountered and error, (or got canceled by the user.)

## client args to add:

- [x] ~~"check if engagement is done"~~
- [x] "send from piped input" arg
- [] "parse from output file" arg (will parse from the output file generated by the command.) (will need program to be specified.)
- [] query database arg based on:
  - [x] host
  - [x] port
  - [x] service
  - [x] service version
  - [x] "has this web-dir"
  - [] "if vulnerable to this vulnerability (from CVE (maybe from nmap vuln scan?))"
  - [x] username
  - [x] password
- [] manually add data to database. (this can be achieved through manually generating sql `INSERT` queries and the `query --sql` flag. although id like to make some wrapper flags and stuff.)
- [x] "is engagement still going?" (done through `ptdb engagement -c`)

## parsers to write before MVP release:

- [x] nmap
- [x] nmap ping (base parser supports this mode)
- [x] fping (its old but its gets the job done)
- [x] feroxbuster
- [x] gobuster (only have a parser for the dir subcmd. I should write once for other gobuster subcmds, like vhost, dns, fuz, etc)
- [x] rustscan
- [x] john
- [x] john show
- [x] hydra (could use some battle testing.)

## future parsers:

- nmap vuln (this is gonna be a while)
- aircrack-ng (this will be the longest)
- wfuzz 
- ffuf

## maybe parsers:

- searchsploit
- sqlmap (how would data from an sql db be stored in an sql db?)
  - hint: check structure of "information_schema" database from MySQL might help as it is basically a meta database (db that stores data about other dbs)
- dig/dog
