# Development Notes:

---

- use PostgreSQL for database bc metasploit does (no reason to have two sql db's on one system)
- maybe add ability to interface with metasploit's sql db (so the user can use out side scanning tools and use those results in metasploit)
- add an argument to the client to check if the engagement is done. that way I can conditionally source a shell script from `~/.zshrc`
- add parser setting for wether to run program encountered and error, (or got canceled by the user.)

## client args to add:

- ~~"check if engagement is done"~~
- "send from piped input" arg
- "send from file" arg (will need program or parser to be specified)
- query database arg based on:
  - host
  - port
  - service
  - service version
  - "has this web-dir"
  - "if vulnerable to this vulnerability (from searchsploit)"
  - "if vulnerable to this vulnerability (from CVE (maybe from nmap vuln scan?))"
  - username
  - password
- manually add data to database.
- "is engagement still going?" that way i can use it in the `precmd` shell function

## parsers to write before MVP release:

- [x] nmap
- [x] nmap ping (base parser supports this mode)
- [x] fping (its old but its gets the job done)
- [x] feroxbuster
- [x] gobuster (omly have a parser for the dir subcmd. I should write once for other gobuster subcmds, like vhost enum mode)
- [x] rustscan
- [x] john
- [x] john show
- [] hydra (have examples now i need to write it.)
- [] dig/dog

## future parsers:

- nmap vuln (this is gonna be a while)
- aircrack-ng
- wfuzz
- ffuf

## maybe parsers:

- searchsploit
- sqlmap (how would data from an sql db be stored in an sql db?)
  - hint: check structure of "information_schema" database from MySQL might help as it is basically a meta database (db that stores data about other dbs)
- dig
