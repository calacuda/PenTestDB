# Development Notes:
---
- use PostgreSQL for database bc metasploit does (no reason to have two sql db's on one system)
- maybe add ability to interface with metasploit's sql db (so the user can use out side scanning tools and use those results in metasploit)
- add an argument to the client to check if the engagement is done. that way I can conditionally source a shell script from `~/.zshrc`

## client args to add:
- ~~"check if engagement is done"~~
- "send from piped input" arg
- "send from file" arg (will need program or parser to be specified)
- query database arg based on:
  - host
  - port
  - service
  - service version
  - "has this web-dir"
  - "if vulnerable to this vulnerability (from searchsploit)"
  - "if vulnerable to this vulnerability (from CVE (maybe from nmap vuln scan?))"
  - username
  - password
- manually add data to database.

## parsers to write before MVP release:
 - nmap
 - feroxbuster
 - gobuster
 - rustscan
 - searchsploit
 - john
 - hydra

## future parsers:
- aircrack-ng
- wfuzz
- ffuf

## maybe parsers:
- sqlmap (how would data from an sql db be stored in an sql db?)
    - hint: check structure of "information_schema" database from MySQL might help as it is basically a meta database (db that stores data about other dbs)
