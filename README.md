# PenTestDB

---

NOTE: This project is in very early development. It is not complete, expect bugs and weired behavior. 

PenTestDB parses the output of various pentesting commands and then stores that data in an SQL database for later reference. The advantage of this is when working in large networks, or with many hosts, it can be easy to loose once way. With this tool the pentester can use SQL queries to sort through all the information they have found about the targets. For Example, which known and scanned hosts have port 80/TCP (HTTP) open? The Pentester can use an SQL query like this: `SELECT host FROM ports WHERE port = '80' AND porotocol = 'TCP';` to answer that question.  PenTestDB supports plug-ins so you can write your own parser for custom commands or scripts, or if there just isn't a parser for a program you use.

## Running/Testing:

1. first source the file `shell/start.sh` from this repo from either your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`. then start a new shell.

2. the following will build the client and then run the server in the current terminal.

```shell
$ cargo build --bin=ptdb; cargo run --bin=ptdb-server 
```

3. play around and squash bugs.
