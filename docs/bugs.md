- fails to merge nmap when doing version scans. gets error: `parse() | merging data from command 'nmap -sV $IP -p $PORTS', failed with error:
  parser output a key without a value`
- interpretation of pipes is broken (uses first command not actual output.)
- that bug with the `command_uid` not being filled in correctly.
