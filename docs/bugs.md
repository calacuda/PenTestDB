- ~~fails to merge nmap when doing version scans. gets error: `parse() | merging data from command 'nmap -sV $IP -p $PORTS', failed with error: parser output a key without a value`~~
- interpretation of pipes is broken (uses first command not actual output. to fix this write some code to identify comand by code output.)
- base_nmap.py doesn't add machine name.
