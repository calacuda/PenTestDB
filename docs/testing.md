# intro

testing of ptdb is done with docker compose. this file documents that testing prosedure.

## running the tests

on the first run the container needs to be built so run `docker compose build; docker compose up --exit-code-from ptdb-test`. on subsequent runs you only need to run the command, `docker compose up --exit-code-from ptdb-test`.

## how the tests work

the docker compose files has multiple docker containers to simulate a whole netowrk. theres an attacker container that runs ptdb, a database container to store the generated data, and other miscellaneous containers to simulate a computer network. the attacker container simply runs a script that runs commadns and pushes teh retrieved data to the database; then it queries the database to check that the stored data is correct. this script is called: `tests/test.sh`.
